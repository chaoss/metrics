# Metric: Diversity

**Background:**
At the Open Source Summit North America, a group of around 8-12 people each agreed on the metrics important in the following scenarios.
For now, we will focus our conversation around these outcomes to further the conversation.
The two-hour session sparked great conversations but could not address all aspects.
We thank everyone who participated.

Below is the metric->signal->action chain for *Diversity*.

## Diversity: Metric -> Signal -> Action

### Case Characteristics
- How accessible is the project to join, contribute, and remain engaged? Informs a contributor’s ability to engage with a project. 

### Contributor Demographics
    -New contributors versus maintainers. Are new contributors different from existing community - Gender, company, age, location, skills, etc…
    - *Why:* Determine whether a project is dominated by a single company or demographic group
    - *Signals:*
        - Low diversity signals that it is hard to contribute to the project if you are not a member of the majority demographic.
        - High diversity signals that new members are welcome.
    - *Informs activity:*

    - *Potential positive or negative outcomes:*
        - (not discussed at OSSNA)

### Onboarding
- Percentage of accepted Pull Requests from new contributors. Percentage of new contributor code versus total code.
- *Why:* 
    - Determine how easy it is to commit code (drive-bys)
    - Determine how easy it is to join a community and contribute.
- *Signals:*
    - That the community welcomes new contributions.
- *Informs activity:*
- (not discussed at OSSNA)
- *Potential positive or negative outcomes:*
- (not discussed at OSSNA)

### Retention
- Is the path to maintainer communicated? When was the last time they added a maintainer?
- *Why:* 
    - Determine if the community is merit based.
    - How are you treated once you are in the community?
    - Length of time to normalize in the community.
- *Signals*
