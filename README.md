# CHAOSS Metrics

Welcome to the repository of the CHAOSS Metrics Committee!

We will develop implementation-agnostic metrics and use this repository in the process.
This repository will hold sample implementation, such as SQL-queries, that may be re-used by other implementation projects.

## CHAOSS Metrics Committee

The CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics for OSS) Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. The CHAOSS Metrics Committee goals are to establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.
