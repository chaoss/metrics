# CHAOSS Metrics

Welcome to the repository of the CHAOSS Metrics Committee.

We  develop implementation-agnostic metrics and use this repository in the process.
This repository will hold sample implementation, such as SQL-queries, that may be re-used by other implementation projects.

## CHAOSS Metrics Committee

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. Such metrics are aimed at undestanding community activity, diversity, and lifecycles. Th Metrics Committee will optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.
