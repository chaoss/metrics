# CHAOSS Metrics

Welcome to the CHAOSS Metrics repository. CHAOSS Metrics repository captures metrics for assessing open source community health and sustainability. Such metrics are aimed at understanding project diversity & inclusion, growth-maturity-decline, risk, and value. For more information about the CHAOSS project go to our website at: https://chaoss.community/

## Goals of CHAOSS Metrics 

(1) Capturing metrics based on the work of community members who have participated at CHAOSS events, worked in the repo, and discussed through on email. We capture the metrics that people find meaningful to their particular contexts when understanding project health and sustainability. In this, we work to represent metrics through concise definitions, known uses cases, sample visualizations, and sample implementations. The CHAOSS Metrics repository captures all potential metrics. It is the WGs that make these metrics meaningful, leading to our second goal. 

(2) Participating with the CHAOSS workgroups. Through these workgroups, we consolidate metrics in meaningful ways and inform the metrics by questioning how to capture and deploy (or not) them:

[CHAOSS Diversity & Inclusion Workgroup](https://github.com/chaoss/wg_diversity_inclusion)

[CHAOSS Growth, Maturity, Decline Workgroup](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd)

[CHAOSS Value Workgroup](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value)

[CHAOSS Risk Workgroup](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-risk)

## Some Reasons to Assess Community Health

  * Risk Mitigation
  * Track Corporate Engagement
  * Identify Sustainable Projects
  * Identify Single Points of Failure
  * Avoid In-take of an Inactive Project
  * Identify Open Source Projects that Need Support
  * Assess Value Generated through Community and Engagement
  * Show that Active Community Management Bears Desired Results

## Some Issues To Look At

  * Project Maturity
  * Project Viability
  * Growth of Community
  * Momentum of Community
  * Diversity of Community
  * Timeliness of Maintainers
  * Attentiveness of Maintainers
  * Activity Level - Responsiveness
  * Distribution of Code Contributions
  * Vanity metrics (might have use in other cases, e.g. stars)
  * Ecosystem Health (upstream, downstream, and related projects)
  * Aggregate Project-tree Health (combined health metrics of all linked dependencies)

## Some Contexts to Consider When Evaluating Health

  * Value Derivation
  * Style of Project
  * Project Comparison
  * Maturity of Project
  * Programming Language
  * Quality of Ecosystem
  * Community Composition

# Full List of Activity Metrics

The following is a full list of identified metrics. How the metrics live in practice is work that happens in the workgroups. 

**Please note that there is a folder called "metrics_scratchpad" underneath the activity-metrics folder. This directory is for metrics that are nascent ideas but have not been through our metric naming and classification process yet. We are trying to name all the metrics according to the types of data they characterize. For example, metrics related to "code" are prefixed with "code-", etc.**

## How to Contribute and Participate to the CHAOSS Project

[Contribute and Participate](https://chaoss.community/participate/). If you would like to propose a new metric to this repository, open a new issue and provide a pull request to open the discussion about inclusion. If you would like to provide metric details, we have a __[metric-template](activity-metrics/metric-template.md)__ to be used. Follow the same approach regarding an issue/pull request to have your detail changes discussed and potentially merged.
