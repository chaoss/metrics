# CHAOSS Metrics Committee

Welcome to the repository of the CHAOSS Metrics Committee. The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source community health and sustainability. Such metrics are aimed at understanding project risk, diversity & inclusion, growth-maturity-decline, and value. The Metrics Committee will optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry and OSS world.

For more information go to our website at: https://chaoss.community/
