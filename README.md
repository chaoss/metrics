# CHAOSS Metrics

Welcome to the repository of the CHAOSS Metrics Committee.

We  develop implementation-agnostic metrics and use this repository in the process.
This repository will hold sample implementation, such as SQL-queries, that may be re-used by other implementation projects.

## CHAOSS Metrics Committee

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. Such metrics are aimed at understanding community activity, diversity, and lifecycles. The Metrics Committee will optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry and OSS world.

## Where to contribute

Work on metrics is currently centered around the areas of  [Diversity-Participation](1_Diversity-Participation.md), [Growth-Maturity-Decline](2_Growth-Maturity-Decline.md), [Risk](3_Risk.md), [Dependency](4_Dependency.md), and [Value](5_Value.md).

Work on comparing metrics tools is led by Jason Clark in his repository: [CHAOSS Product Comparison](https://github.com/jasontclark/chaoss-product-comparison).
