## CHAOSS Metric Quality Checklist
This checklist is used for new and updated metrics to ensure we follow CHAOSS quality standards and processes. Below checklist items don’t have to be completed all at once: create the metric release candidate issue first and then start working on the checklist.

### Process

- [ ] Create the “review issue” in the authoring WG’s repo for comments during review period and paste this template in
- [ ] Create pull request to edit or add metric to WG’s repo (after checking Content Quality and Technical Requirements below)
- [ ] Add the new metric or metric edit to release notes issue in working group repo
- [ ] Update spreadsheet of metrics 
- [ ] Create issue in [CHAOSS/Translations repository](https://github.com/chaoss/translations) to kick-off translation to other languages (please use the the translation issue template)
- [ ] "Metric Candidate Release" label added to the metric release candidate issue.
- [ ] Metric was added to website
- [ ] Announce new/updated metric on mailing list, newsletter, community Zoom call, and Twitter. This can be coordinated with the community manager.

### Content Quality

- [ ] Required headings are filled in, including Questions.

- [ ] If any, DEI uses of the metric are included Objectives

- [ ] Images have at least one empty line above and below them
- [ ] Ensure images are placed in image folder and followed [naming convention](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/resources/metrics-template.md)

- [ ] Within the focus area, add the metric in the table and provide the link to the metric and metric question
