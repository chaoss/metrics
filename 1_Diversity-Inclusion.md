**Disclaimer:**
The activity metrics listed are not meant to represent a fully comprehensive list. It is fully expected that this list will evolve as people have insights and thoughts about the activity metrics that comprise Diversity and Inclusion. It is very likely that activity metrics in Diversity and Inclusion are not able to be fully articulated via online trace data. In particular, Contributor Demographics is likely best understood through self-reporting. See: https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics

**Tooling:**
The activity metrics are intended to be a starting point for community health related tooling. It is expected that the activity metrics will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of tooling to successfully implement the activity metrics.

**Background:**
The activity metrics have been identified based on workshops at the Open Source Leadership and the Open Source Summit North America. In addition, the activity metrics are based on active CHAOSS mailing list conversations. The activity metrics listed here are the result of compiling the discussions to data. We thank everyone who participated.
