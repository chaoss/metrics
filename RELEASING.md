## RELEASING CHAOSS METRICS

This document provides requirements for releasing CHAOSS metrics. Below defines the necessary steps: 

1. Metrics must be associated with a CHAOSS working group
2. Metrics must be associated with a working group's focus area
3. Metrics must have an associated question that is being addressed
4. Metrics must have an associated detail page providing more information about the metric. Examples:
    * https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/metrics/contributors.md
    * https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/governance/board-council-diversity.md
5. Metrics must be consistently referenced across the CHAOSS organization. This typically includes (1) the name/question listing in the focus area, (2) the name/question listing on the detail page, and (3) name/question listing in the aggregate metric list at: https://github.com/chaoss/metrics
6. Metrics must be identified as 'ready for release' in the following spreadsheet: 
    * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jwkwzs8s6SAm2vVY-8lzTQk3YT0YpOveTlKOwjd2eQ/edit#gid=0

Once these criteria are met, open an issue at: https://github.com/chaoss/metrics indicating the working group and metrics for release.
