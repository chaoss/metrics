## RELEASING CHAOSS METRICS ##

This document provides requirements for releasing CHAOSS metrics. Below defines the necessary steps: 

1. Metrics must be associated with a CHAOSS working group
2. Metrics must be associated with a working group focus area
3. Metrics must have an associated question being addressed
4. Metrics must have an associated detail page providing more information about the metric. Examples can be found at:
1. https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/focus-areas/governance/board-council-diversity.md
  and
2. https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/metrics/contributors.md
5. Metrics must be consistently referenced across the CHAOSS organization. This typically includes (1) the name/question listing in the focus area, (2) the name/question listing on the detail page, and (3) name/question listing in the aggregate metric list found at: https://github.com/chaoss/metrics
6. Metrics must be identified as 'ready for release' in the following spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jwkwzs8s6SAm2vVY-8lzTQk3YT0YpOveTlKOwjd2eQ/edit#gid=0

Once these criteria are met, open an issue at: https://github.com/chaoss/metrics indicating metrics for release.
