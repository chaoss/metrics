# Metric: Growth-Maturity-Decline

**Background:**
At the Open Source Summit North America, a group of around 8-12 people each agreed on the metrics important in the following scenarios.
For now, we will focus our conversation around these outcomes to further the conversation.
The two-hour session sparked great conversations but could not address all aspects.
We thank everyone who participated.

Below is the metric->signal->action chain for *Growth-Maturity-Decline*.
