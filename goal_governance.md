## Governance

Goal: Identify how diverse and inclusive our governance is.

This one is a bit tricker, because governance varies by project.
We might want to investigate or specifically call out governance model by [archetype](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MZOTS_OS_Archetypes_report_ext_scr.pdf).

Name | Question
--- | ---
Foundation Staff Diversity | What is the diversity of foundation staff?
Board/Council Diversity | What is the diversity within our governing board or council?
Code of Conduct| Is the CoC *and* enforcement process visible, clear and current?
Code of Conduct Enforcement| Is enforcement process running at scale?(volume, responsiveness, accuracy, fairness ...)
Team/Module Ownership Diversity | What is the diversity of other bureaucratic and administrative foundation teams, e.g. working groups, committees, or ambassador groups?
Path to Influence | What opportunities are there to move into governance?
