## Recognition of Good Work

Goal: Identify how we recognize/reward good work in our community.

Name  |  Question
--- | ---
Contribution Type  |  Does recognition skew to a particular kind of contribution? How are we missing altogether(see Contribution for a list of types identified to track)
Contribution Volume | Do we have a bias towards small contributions or multiple contributions?
Recognition Type | TBD (i.e. thank you in PR comments, blog post, badges, etc.)
Recognition Value | Do different demographics value different types of recognition?  (qualitative?)
