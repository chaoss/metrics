# Metric: Value

Activity Metric | Description
--- | ---
Codebase Cost | An estimate of the market cost to develop the functionality of the project.  For example: [OpenHub](https://blog.openhub.net/project_codebase_cost/)
Software Downloads | Number of project software downloads
Downloads of Non-software Artifacts | Number of downloads of non-software artifacts (e.g. documentation, sample apps, test suites, etc.)
Installs | Number of software installations of the project
Number of Active Users | Number of active users of the project
Commercial Offerings | Availability of commercial products or services based on the project
Availability of Add-on Products | Availability of 3rd party plug-ins, modules, utilities, etc. that provide additional functionality for the project's software
V-index | An index of project's first-order and second-order downstream dependencies. The definition of the v-index is that a project with a v-index of *h* has *h* downstream dependent projects each of which has *h* downstream dependencies themselves. For exmaple: A project vith a v-index of 15 is a dependency for 15 other project which themselves have at least 15 downstream dependencies themselves.

**Disclaimer:**
The activity metrics listed are not meant to represent a fully comprehensive list. It is fully expected that this list will evolve as people have insights and thoughts about the activity metrics that comprise Value.

**Tooling:**
The activity metrics are intended to be a starting point for community health related tooling. It is expected that the activity metrics will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of tooling to successfully implement the activity metrics.

**Background:**
The activity metrics have been identified based on workshops at the Open Source Leadership and the Open Source Summit North America. In addition, the activity metrics are based on active CHAOSS mailing list conversations. The activity metrics listed here are the result of compiling the discussions to data. We thank everyone who participated.
