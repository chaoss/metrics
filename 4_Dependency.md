# Metric: Ecosystem

**Background:**
At the Open Source Summit North America, a group of around 8-12 people each agreed on the metrics important in the following scenarios.
For now, we will focus our conversation around these outcomes to further the conversation.
The two-hour session sparked great conversations but could not address all aspects.
We thank everyone who participated.

**Note:** The metric *Dependency* was not detailed out at OSSNA. Contributions are welcome.

**Note:** The metric was previously called *Ecosystem* but was renamed to avoid potential confusion with measuring the health of an entire ecosystem.
