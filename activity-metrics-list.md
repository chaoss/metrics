# List of Activity Metrics

We list and describe activity metrics. For different situations, the metrics have different meanings. Each activity metric can be used in association with other metrics in the creations of value-oriented health metrics. We have a __[metric-template](activity-metrics/metric-template.md)__ to be used for new detail metric pages.


|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Accepted Code Contributions|Percentage of new contributor code versus total code over time.|
|Age of Community|Time since repository/organization was registered; or time since first release. "Results showed that the age of the project played a marginally significant role in attracting active users, but not developers. We attribute this differential effect of age on users and developers to the fact that age may be seen as an indicator of application maturity by users, and hence taken as a positive signal, whereas it may convey more ambiguous signals to developers." (Chengalur-Smith et al., 2010, p.674) (Grewal, Lilien, & Mallapragada, 2006).|

Compare the activity between committers-as-a-group and contributors-as-a-group. It easily shows when a project is not yet popular, or when a project is not paying attention to its users. I also feel that a balance between the two groups is essential; ie) a project with a lot more contributor than committer activity is one that is failing to recruit committers quickly enough.|

# Additional Thoughts
The following section are a collection of random thoughts that might be helpful in a future discussion.

## Reasons why community health is assessed

This includes reasons why metrics are considered for other reasons This section collects notes on what possible goals might be.

  * Track Corporate Engagement (is an organization creating value, are organizational goals met, employee contributions)
  * Risk mitigation
  * Identify open source projects that need support.
  * Identify single points of failure (and hopefully prevent them)
  * Assess value generated through community and engagement
  * Show that active community management bears desired results. (Measurable outcomes)
  * Avoid in-take of an inactive project, because it makes it difficult to maintain and might carry unknown bugs and security issues.
  * Sustainability: "we define a sustainable project as one that exhibits software development and maintenance activity over the long run." (Chengalur-Smith, Sidorova, & Daniel, 2010, p.660)

## Broad categories of indicators that we hear often

These categories are meta-concepts that cannot be assessed with a single metric and the combination of metrics will be different depending on the context.

  * Growth of community
  * Momentum of community
  * Timeliness of maintainers
  * Diversity of community, contributions, and in code base
  * Distribution of code contributions (beyond project creator)
  * Activity level - Responsiveness
  * Viability (e.g. Bus Factor - individual contributors and clustered by employer)
  * Maturity
  * Ecosystem health (upstream, downstream, and related projects)
  * Vanity metrics (might have use in other cases, e.g. stars)
  * Aggregate project-tree health (combined health metrics of all linked dependencies)
  * Attentiveness of maintainers to users. See [Mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/oss-health-metrics/2017-March/000007.html.md)

## Context: Considerations when evaluating health

  * Style of project
  * Programming language
  * Maturity of project (Projects might seem inactive but rather have fulfilled their goal and community remains responsive to bug reports and security issues, just no new features)
  * Quality of Ecosystem (metrics of related projects)
  * Value driven metrics (not just activity)
  * Development of metrics over time
  * External users might not be a homogenous group - consider different metrics
  * Compare similar projects (manually determine which projects to compare)
  * Classifications (based on a set of metrics, which projects 'behave' similar)
  * Interrelationships between categories of indicators (maturity might be high while activity low and response rate is up)
  * Aggregate from repository, to project, to community, (to company)

## Other classifications for indicators

We have heard other classifications that we simply list here.

Ideas for these classifications is to
1. generate a uniform classification and through conversations merge the different classifications.
2. create mappings of the indicators to the different classifications

  * Community/Code/Risk
  * Activity/Viability/Risk
