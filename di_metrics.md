# Category: Diversity and Inclusion

Goal: Identify the diversity and inclusion within a project.

## Definitions
Some of the language we use, and what we mean.

* **Diversity**: How different are the people present?
* **Inclusion**: How well do we enable these different people to work together?
* **Retention**: How long do different people stay engaged?
* **Attraction**: How well do we extend a hand to different newcomers?

*Example 1:* Two people in a room. They can be diverse, but they don’t have to work together or stay there until tomorrow. AND just because someone is there, doesn’t mean their experience is great.

*Example 2:* Some minorities are not necessarily visible, do we want to measure their degree of visibility/outness? (e.g., disability, socio-economic, LGBTIQ, religion)

*Example 3:* There may be women within a community that is less inclusive, but the women are determined to “see it through” and participate. In this case, retention does not necessarily reflect the level of inclusion within a community.

## Dimensions of Demographics
NOTE: that *how* we might ask these questions, and what potential answers might be are currently out of scope.  
NOTE: that regional appropriateness of demographics is also currently out of scope, and will be its own task.
NOTE: that the legal, privacy and ethical issues related to asking for, storing and visualizing data is currently out of scope, and will be its own task.

2. Sexual orientation
3. Age
4. Location/Region/Country
6. Socioeconomic status
7. Tenure (time with project) / Tenure with the ecosystem
