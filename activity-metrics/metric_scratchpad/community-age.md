# Community Age

## 1. Description
Time since repository/organization was registered; or time since first release. "Results showed that the age of the project played a marginally significant role in attracting active users, but not developers. We attribute this differential effect of age on users and developers to the fact that age may be seen as an indicator of application maturity by users, and hence taken as a positive signal, whereas it may convey more ambiguous signals to developers." (Chengalur-Smith et al., 2010, p.674) (Grewal, Lilien, & Mallapragada, 2006).
