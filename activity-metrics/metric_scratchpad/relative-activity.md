# Relative Activity

## 1. Description
Sum up the activities (GH issues+comments, GH pull requests+comments and GH commits) for the project members and for the non-project members, then create a ratio of the two. Compare the activity between committers-as-a-group and contributors-as-a-group. It easily shows when a project is not yet popular, or when a project is not paying attention to its users. I also feel that a balance between the two groups is essential; ie) a project with a lot more contributor than committer activity is one that is failing to recruit committers quickly enough.
