# Open Issues Age

## 1. Description
### questions

  - Referring back to issue resolution efficiency, is there a type of issue that is "stagnant" and not closed which we would not like to include? 
  - Should we throw away outliers that remain open extraordinarily long? => Not sure if this is a good practice.  I think a project/team lead should actively review unresolved issues and disposition them somehow (even if it's to simply say "this issue won't/can't be addressed due to XYZ" before "closing" the issue)
  - Might a survey of repositories yield a collection of tags that equate to "long term issue", adn could be filtered out? 


## 2. Use Cases
Provide examples of how the metric might inform different stakeholders through use cases.

## 3. Formula
A generic formula (in pseudo code) to generate the metric.

## 4. Sample Filter and Visualization
Include a Sample Filter and Visualization (screenshot) of the metric from any implementation.

## 5. Sample Implementation
Likely a GitHub API call will be most efficient. 

## 6. Known Implementations
Examples of where and how metric is used. (include links to dashboard or location where metric is visible or is talked about having been used).

## 7. Test Cases (Examples)
Sample inputs (including contexts) and expected outputs for this metric. Implementers can test their implementations against these test cases. For quantitative metrics, this could include a static repository with known metric results, or just inputs and output. For qualitative metrics, this may be more difficult.

## 8. External References (Literature)
Blog posts, websites, academic papers, or books that mention the metric.
